ProductHunt has over 1 million user signups.
More than 60% of those are bots.

## How it started

I’ve used [ProductHunt][producthunt] since early 2014.
Besides [Hacker News][hacker news], it was a good way to see the latest product launches in tech.
Using the comments on products, I could discover similar tools or collect feedback on my own products.
Lately though, I’ve noticed most of the comments seem to be generated by ChatGPT.

## A simple test

To test my theory, I launched my own product on ProductHunt but with a simple LLM prompt injection in the product’s description.
Sure enough, almost all the comments were automated.

Can you spot the bots?

Now we see that it’s a waste of time for people launching on ProductHunt to reply to comments.
Is launching on ProductHunt even worth it?
If so many bots are commenting, they must be upvoting too right?
Based on all the emails I receive offering votes for money, some people must be purchasing upvotes.
[This person][reddit example 1] even claims they paid for ProductHunt upvotes twice.

## The data

To analyze upvotes, I found a publicly available list of all ProductHunt users, launches, upvotes, and comments.
ProductHunt has over 1 million user sign ups, over 300 thousand launches, 2.5 million comments, and 20 million upvotes.
Each product also has a daily rank, which is the score after 24 hours from midnight PDT when each new launch day starts.
First place is daily rank `1`.
I didn’t check what the lowest rank was, but some products have `null` rank.
Maybe those were deleted, flagged, or never launched.

## Detecting bot accounts

Detecting bots is difficult, especially with only public data.
At first, I tried analyzing the times of day of user comments to find trends.
For example, here’s one user who signed up 677 days ago, commented 2,009 times and upvoted 4,649 launches.
Definitely a power user and using some automation, but probably not a bot (and wasn’t categorized as one).

<img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/user-comment-hours-hist-real.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Comments by hour histogram real" title="Comments by hour histogram real" style="width:80%" />

Now look at a bot user’s comments.
This user signed up 140 days ago, commented 173 times and upvoted 246 launches.

<img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/user-comment-hours-hist-bot.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Comments by hour histogram bot" title="Comments by hour histogram bot" style="width:80%" />

Notice how the bot comments at regular intervals and the chart looks boxy instead of smooth?

However, this wasn’t enough to detect bot accounts alone.
I assigned each user a risk score based on many different criteria, like account activity duration, upvote patterns over time, number of upvotes shared with other bots, and content of comments.
Did you know ChatGPT generated comments have a higher frequency of words like `game-changer`?
Bot comments also contained characters not easily typeable, like [em-dash][emdash], or the product’s name verbatim even when it’s very long or contains characters like `™` in the name.
They also commonly included the name and bio word for word from a real person’s LinkedIn profile, but those people said they never created any ProductHunt account.
Clustering works to an extent, but many bot accounts are thrown away after used so the bots only share one similar vote out of their many random votes.
I ran some clustering, but only on small data sets because [cupy][cupy] and [cudf][cudf] haven’t implemented the necessary methods to run on GPUs.
If someone has more experience with this, clustering might improve bot detection.

In the end, I detected over 60% of user signups to be automated bot accounts.
That’s a conservative number, because I didn’t detect all the bots.
It would be a lot easier for ProductHunt themselves to detect bot activity more accurately using insider data.

## Bot activity over time

### User signups

Since 2018, there have been more bot users created than real users.

### Comments

In late 2022, bot comments really took off... around the same time ChatGPT was first widely available.
The spike in 2024 is because over time bot accounts are deleted, I’m not sure if by ProductHunt or by the account owner.
Newer accounts are more likely to not have been deleted, so we still have access to their comments.

### Upvotes

Also in 2022, bot upvotes surpassed real votes.

These bots form voting rings where makers pay for upvotes to increase their chances of getting into the ProductHunt newsletter.

### Rankings

Most launches get only a few real upvotes.
Since bots vote randomly to blend in, the bot trend line is smoother than the real user upvotes.

## Daily rank

First place launches get featured in the daily and weekly ProductHunt newsletter, so let’s see how many bot upvotes the top launches receive.

Looks like 15% bot votes is a safe amount to get your product in first place for the day.
Anything over 60% bot votes doesn’t seem to make it to first place for some reason.
Here’s the same chart limited to launches after 2020, showing bots are accounting for more of the upvotes in top posts lately.

Launches paying for upvotes probably aren’t high quality products, so they often rank top 5 instead of first place:

## Worth it?

Is launching on ProductHunt worth it?
Even though most comments and upvotes are bots, there’s probably still some real humans using ProductHunt... maybe.
If you pay the bots and get featured in the newsletter, my guess is more real humans will see your product.

[Some people][reddit example 2] think it gives you backlink SEO juice, but it doesn’t.
For Google to count a backlink, the `a` link element pointing to your product must not contain [nofollow][nofollow].
If you inspect the ProductHunt website, you’ll see the link to your product contains `nofollow` meaning search engines won’t count it as a backlink.
If you only input one link in your product it’s actually a `button` element using JavaScript to open your product page, not even a real link.
Maybe other aggregator sites will pick up your launch and link, but ProductHunt itself does not count as a backlink.

One group who does care about being #1 on ProductHunt are investors, so if you’re talking to investors it might help to have that badge on your launch.

Overall, in my opinion it’s still worth launching on ProductHunt however I wouldn’t spend more than a few minutes preparing the launch and definitely don’t waste time replying to comments.

## Final Thoughts

I wanted to create a list of launches without the bot votes, to see if the top launch of the day changes with the bot votes are removed.
However, I don’t want to call out launches that didn’t really pay for votes but just happen to have many upvotes from bots, and I don’t want more publicity for the launches that did pay.
Either way, I’ve spent too much time on this already so that will have to wait for a possible future blog post.

Get ready for your yearly 2025 wrapped code stats.

<div style="position:relative;margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;padding-bottom:57.23370429252782%;height:0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/ffb3dee664604d388b2d8f9f22ddea77" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

We release the yearly stats [every January][previous blogs] after New Years, to make sure we include your work up to the last second including any holiday coding.

### What’s new

Some exciting new key features we’re pleased to share with you this month:

- 🤖 WakaTime for Claude Code?!? - track how much you use AI when coding

- 📊 Filter your dashboard by Client - view projects, stats, hours, etc. by client

- 👜 We helped design the ultimate tech backpack - made for techies by techies


### 🤖 Track Your AI-Coding Time

AI-assisted coding has rapidly become a part of our everyday workflows, but there hasn’t been a simple way to measure how much we rely on AI.

We’re excited to announce [WakaTime for Claude Code][claude plugin] and Copilot detection in [VS Code][vscode plugin].

    claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/wakatime/claude-code-wakatime.git
    claude plugin i claude-code-wakatime@wakatime

Once installed, WakaTime measures your coding activity inside Claude Code just like it does for your IDEs.
No manual timers, no interruptions—just accurate insight into how much you use AI when coding.

This unlocks some powerful possibilities:

- See the percentage of your coding time spent using AI
- Compare your AI-assisted work across projects
- Understand how AI impacts your productivity and output

Also, when using [WakaTime for VS Code][vscode plugin] WakaTime shows how many lines of code you write manually vs. generated using AI.
We’re working on adding support for AI code detection to [more IDEs][plugins] soon.

### 📊 Filter Your Dashboard by Client

Many developers juggle work across multiple clients or stakeholders.
This month we’re rolling out [Client Filters][client filters]:

Whether you’re freelancing, working at an agency, or just making sense of where your week went, Client Filters help you separate your work into meaningful buckets.

This means easier billing, clearer reporting, and fewer spreadsheets.

### 👜 The Ultimate Tech Backpack

<a href="https://www.cargowerk.com/bags/p/berliner-daily-tech-travel-backpack" target="_blank"><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/berliner-backpack.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="tech backpack" title="tech backpack" style="width:70%" /></a>

A good backpack looks stylish, organizes your gear, and provides quick access to each device.
We’ve teamed up with a [designer in Prague][cargowerk] to create the ultimate backpack for devs, designers, and techies.
Here’s why the Berliner backpack is the best tech bag:

- side-access laptop, separate from main compartment

- quick access exterior pocket

- exterior security pocket

- interior hidden pocket with enough room for a [10 year airtag][10 year airtag] or [monimoto][monimoto]

- extra laptop/ipad pouch inside

- detachable train-bag for necessities - store your main bag overhead keeping the essentials with you

- roll top for expandable storage

- cargo net or optional elastic netting for sweater or jacket

After more than a year of prototyping, feedback, and real world testing meet the [Berliner backpack][berliner].
Preorder now, with delivery expected January 2025.

Today, we added a new feature to your team dashboard: Downloading your team activity as CSV!

<a href="https://wakatime.com/teams"><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/team-download-csv.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="team download screenshot" /></a>

To download your team projects and contributor activity, click the blue download icon at the top of your team dashboard.
A CSV file will download with the information from your current dashboard view.

Not part of a team? It's ok, you can still use our [public API][api] to get your dashboard data as JSON, or export all your coding activity as a data dump from your [account settings page][settings].

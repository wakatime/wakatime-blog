In 2025, more than 500k developers spent a combined 61 million hours programming, tracked with [WakaTime plugins][plugins].
The average person spent 51 minutes per day programming, almost the same as [last year][last year blog] but about 30 seconds more on average.

Each year we release a [personalized coding report][report] showing your accomplishments over the last year.

We also include average trends for all WakaTime devs showing the most used languages, IDEs, and operating systems.
These trends come from aggregating the WakaTime personal dashboard metrics when a developer installs one of our [IDE plugins][plugins].
We can find new trends among software engineers using this data, for example this year:

* devs are using [AI-integrated IDEs][editors section] more - 50% VS Code, 14% Cursor, Windsurf, Trae, and Claude Code all increasing
* IDEs without AI tooling are decreasing in usage
* Python took 2nd place pushing JavaScript into 3rd
* TypeScript is still the most used language
* Vim is dead, long live Neovim

## New Features & Milestones

### [🤖 WakaTime for Claude Code][claude plugin]
We’ve released a [Claude Code plugin][claude plugin] that tracks how many lines of code you generate using AI, and the time you spend using Claude Code.
Along with adding AI sidebar detection to our [VS Code plugin][vscode plugin], monitor your AI adoption over time.

### [📊 Filter dashboard by Client][invoicing]
Many developers juggle work across multiple clients or stakeholders.
This month we’re rolling out [Client Filters][client filters] for viewing code stats for specific client projects.

### [👜 We helped design the ultimate tech backpack][berliner]
A good backpack looks stylish, organizes your gear, and provides quick access to each device.
We’ve teamed up with a [designer in Prague][cargowerk] to create the ultimate backpack for devs, designers, and techies.
After more than a year of prototyping, feedback, and real world testing meet the [Berliner backpack][berliner].
